## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/eliascreates/todo-sprint.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd todo-sprint
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:

```
flutter run
```

The app should now be running on your emulator or connected device.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a Clean Architecture structure to separate concerns and make the codebase maintainable and scalable.

- `lib/` contains the application code.
  - `feature/` contains the features in the application.
    - `todo/` contains the todo feature with CRUD operations
        - `data/` contains the data layer with repository and data sources implementations.
        - `domain/` contains the domain layer with entities, use cases, and repositories interfaces.
        - `presentation/` contains the presentation layer with the UI, BLoCs, and other UI-related components.

## State Management

The app uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. BLoC allows for separation of UI and business logic and provides a clean way to manage the state of the application.

## Data Storage

The app uses Hive as the local data storage solution for storing todo items. Hive is a lightweight and fast NoSQL database that works well with Flutter apps.

## Themes

Todo Sprint offers both light and dark themes to provide a personalized user experience. You can switch between themes from the app settings.
